Bussiness Problem 
The Supply Chain team has adopted a standardized approach to measure service levels. This includes the daily measurement of 'On-time delivery (OT) %',
'In-full delivery (IF) %', and 'On-Time in Full (OTIF) %' for customer orders, benchmarked against the target service levels established for each customer.
```

```
Solution Approach
There are 3 dimension tables: dim_customers, dim_products, dim_date and 2 fact tables: fact_orders_line, fact_orders_aggregate. Power BI is used as the visualization
tool in this project. The data is imported, analyzed, and transformed in the Power Query Editor. The relationships between the tables have been created in Power Pivot.
